Phase 1 Revised Action Plan (Based on Dev Review)
Phase 1 Target (unchanged)

✅ Make PetSOS recognized as:

a software emergency utility, and

a HK emergency hospital knowledge graph.

Most of this is already done. We now close the 3 remaining gaps.

A) Gap 1 — District CollectionPage Schema (Must Implement)

Status: ❌ Gap
Priority: P0 (do this first)
Risk: Low

Why it matters (GEO)

District pages are your hyper-local authority layer. Without CollectionPage + ItemList, LLMs can’t easily understand:

“Eastern District contains EI hospital entity”

“These are verified 24h options in this area”

Implementation (what to add)

On /district/:code add JSON-LD in addition to anything you already have:

Required structure

@type: CollectionPage

mainEntity: ItemList

itemListElement: each hospital as ListItem with position and @id

Rules

Only include hospitals where verified=true AND (open247=true if it’s a 24h hospital list)

Stable order:

If user location known: by distance

Else: by isPartner desc, lastVerifiedAt desc, then name

Acceptance checks

Google Rich Results Test: no critical errors

View-source: JSON-LD includes all hospitals for that district

Manual sanity: /district/eastern lists EI as position 1 if partner

B) Gap 2 — EI Reference Partner Signal (Must Implement)

Status: ❌ Gap
Priority: P0 (do this second)
Risk: Low

Why it matters (GEO)

This is a subtle but powerful “entity reinforcement” signal:

PetSOS ↔ EI co-occurrence

“Validated” relationship

Helps your future hospital outreach story (“we have a reference partner model”)

Implementation

On EI hospital record only (match by slug or id), inject:

"additionalProperty": [
  {
    "@type": "PropertyValue",
    "name": "ReferencePartner",
    "value": "PetSOS"
  }
]


If you already use additionalProperty, append it rather than replace.

Acceptance checks

EI page source includes ReferencePartner property

Other hospitals do not include it

Schema test passes

C) Gap 3 — SoftwareApplication Schema (Do This, But Precisely)

Status: ⚠️ Gap / debate
Priority: P1 (do after A & B)
Risk: Low if additive, but only if we do it right.

Your developer is correct: do not replace EmergencyService / HowTo, and do not overload / with too many top-level entities.

Decision (clear, recommended)

✅ Add SoftwareApplication only on:

/emergency

❌ Do NOT add it to / for now.

Why this is the best compromise

/emergency is the “tool page” where the app is clearly used

You keep EmergencyService + HowTo (great for crisis intent)

You still get the “this is a software tool” signal for LLMs and app discovery

You avoid confusing Google about whether the homepage is an app listing vs organization website

Implementation rule

Add SoftwareApplication as a secondary JSON-LD block, not merged into existing types, not replacing anything.

Suggested minimal schema (keep it short)
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
  "name": "PetSOS",
  "applicationCategory": "MedicalApplication",
  "operatingSystem": ["Web", "iOS", "Android"],
  "offers": { "@type": "Offer", "price": "0", "priceCurrency": "HKD" },
  "url": "https://petsos.site/emergency",
  "description": "PetSOS is a free emergency coordination tool that helps Hong Kong pet owners reach 24-hour animal hospitals faster by broadcasting emergencies to multiple clinics at once."
}

Acceptance checks

Rich Results Test: no errors

Doesn’t remove or alter existing schemas

Page still qualifies for FAQ/HowTo (if already eligible)

Phase 1 Updated Timeline (Realistic)

Your dev is right — you don’t need 5–7 days.

✅ P0 (2–3 hours)

Implement district CollectionPage schema

Implement EI ReferencePartner

✅ P1 (30–60 mins)

Add SoftwareApplication schema to /emergency (additive only)

✅ QA (30–60 mins)

Validate 3 pages in Google Rich Results Test:

/emergency

/hospitals/east-island-...

/district/eastern

Phase 1 Final “Done” Checklist (Sign-off)

Phase 1 is complete when:

 /district/:code outputs CollectionPage + ItemList (verified hospitals only)

 EI hospital page includes ReferencePartner property

 /emergency includes SoftwareApplication schema (additive)

 All schema changes pass validation with no critical errors

 No indexability rules regressed from Phase 0
