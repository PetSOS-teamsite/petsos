Phase 0 — Governance & Safety (Execution Plan)

Objective:
Make PetSOS crawl-safe, privacy-safe, and trust-safe before any GEO amplification.

Outcome:
Search engines + LLMs see only what they should, and hospitals feel protected.

0️⃣ Phase 0 Success Criteria (Lock This)

Phase 0 is done only when:

❌ No private emergency data is indexable

✅ All public utility pages are indexable

✅ One canonical URL per hospital

✅ Language switching does not create duplicate URLs

✅ Sitemap contains only approved pages

✅ Transparency rules are documented internally

0.1 Indexing & Robots Rules (CRITICAL)
✅ Indexable (must return index,follow)
/emergency
/emergency-symptoms
/hospitals/:slug
/district/:code
/blog/*
/typhoon-status
/about
/verification-process
/medical-advisory

❌ Noindex (must return noindex,nofollow)
/emergency-results/:requestId
/emergency-profile/:requestId
/emergency-results/:requestId/messages
/messages
/profile
/pets
/clinic/dashboard
/admin/*

Implementation checklist

Add <meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow"> on all private routes

Ensure no private route appears in sitemap.xml

Confirm Google Search Console → URL Inspection shows “Excluded by noindex”

Owner: Engineering
Acceptance check:
Manually inspect 2–3 :requestId URLs → must be non-indexable.

0.2 Canonical & Language Handling (Duplicate Safety)
Canonical rules

Canonical URL = /hospitals/:slug

No language-specific canonicals

No query parameters (?lang=zh) in canonical

Language switcher rules

Language toggle does not change URL

Only text changes, not route

No crawlable /zh/ or /en/ paths (for now)

(Optional, later)

If you introduce /zh/ paths later → use hreflang

Do not do this in Phase 0

Owner: Engineering
Acceptance check:
View page source → canonical tag always points to base URL.

0.3 Sitemap.xml (Dynamic & Clean)
Sitemap inclusion rules

Include only:

Hospitals where verified = true

Regions where regions.active = true

Blog posts (all 5)

Core public pages (/emergency, /emergency-symptoms, etc.)

Sitemap fields

<loc> = canonical URL

<lastmod> =

hospitals → updatedAt OR lastVerifiedAt

blogs → updatedAt

No query params

No admin or requestId paths

Automation

Sitemap regenerates daily

Excludes anything with noindex

Owner: Engineering
Acceptance check:
Download sitemap.xml → manually scan for any /admin, /profile, or requestId.

0.4 Transparency Policy (Internal Rulebook)

This is non-technical but critical for hospital trust.

Create a 1-page internal doc defining:

Public (Always Visible)

Opening hours

Emergency capabilities

Species accepted

Logistics (parking, entrance, taxi)

Typhoon / holiday opening status

Verification date

Public with Disclaimer

Consultation fees (exact or band)

Typical wait time

Live status (normal / busy / critical_only)

Internal / Optional

Staff ratios

Exact blood types

ICU nurse count

Internal notes

Required disclaimer (standardised)

“Information is provided for emergency guidance only and may change based on case urgency and hospital conditions.”

Owner: Product / Partnerships
Acceptance check:
Hospital partners can review this and say “yes, we’re comfortable”.

0.5 Hospital Data Publishing Rules (Pre-GEO Guardrails)
Publishing conditions

A hospital page is indexable only if:

verified = true

open247 = true (for 24h hospital pages)

Has minimum required fields:

name

address

phone or WhatsApp

regionId

Fee display rule

Hospital chooses:

exact numbers

ranges

If fees missing → show:

“Fees vary by case. Contact hospital for details.”

Owner: Product / Admin
Acceptance check:
No hospital page shows empty / misleading fee sections.

0.6 Logging & Audit (Silent but Important)

Add internal logging for:

Hospital page updates

Verification changes

Status changes (busy / critical_only)

Purpose:

Partner trust

Internal audits

Future media / data credibility

Owner: Engineering
Acceptance check:
Admin can see when & who changed hospital data.

Phase 0 Deliverables Checklist (Final)

Before moving to Phase 1, confirm all below are ✅:

 Private emergency URLs noindex + removed from sitemap

 Canonical rules verified

 Language toggle does not create crawlable variants

 Sitemap.xml clean and dynamic

 Transparency policy documented

 Hospital publishing rules agreed internally
