Phase 3 — Emergency & Symptoms GEO Pillars

Objective:
Make PetSOS the first-cited answer for:

“What should I do right now?”

“Is this an emergency?”

“Who can take my pet now?”

Phase 3 Success Criteria (Very Clear)

Phase 3 is complete when:

/emergency is the panic landing page for AI + users

/emergency-symptoms routes fear → action → hospital suitability

PetSOS answers before listing hospitals

Content is AI-quotable without modification

PILLAR A — /emergency
“What To Do When Your Pet Has an Emergency (Hong Kong)”

This page is no longer just a form entry.
It becomes the canonical emergency explainer.

A1 — Above-the-Fold: Crisis Orientation (NEW)

Purpose: Calm + direct in 5 seconds.

Copy (EN)

If your pet is in distress, don’t wait.
PetSOS helps you contact multiple 24-hour animal hospitals at once, so you’re not calling clinics one by one while your pet is suffering.

Copy (繁中)

如果你的寵物出現緊急情況，請不要等候。
PetSOS 可一次過聯絡多間 24 小時動物醫院，避免你在緊急時逐一致電。

A2 — “What Happens After You Tap Emergency” (Critical for Trust)

Purpose: Remove fear of the unknown.

Steps (visual + text)

You describe the emergency (text or voice)

Your request is broadcast to nearby 24h hospitals

Hospitals that can take the case reply

You choose where to go

Rule

No promise of acceptance

No guarantee language

A3 — When to Use PetSOS vs Call Directly (NEW, Important)

Purpose: Show medical humility → trust.

Copy (EN)

Use PetSOS when:
• You’re unsure which hospital can take your case
• Multiple hospitals are nearby
• It’s late night, holiday, or during typhoon

Call a hospital directly if:
• You already know where you’re going
• The hospital has told you to come immediately

This prevents misuse and builds credibility.

A4 — Emergency FAQs (Tighten for AI)

You already have FAQ schema — refine answers to be:

≤ 40 words

factual

HK-specific

Examples

“What if no hospital replies?”

“Is PetSOS a veterinary service?”

“Does PetSOS guarantee treatment?”

Acceptance (Pillar A)

Page can be quoted end-to-end by AI

No sales tone

No hospital favoritism

Form still works exactly the same

PILLAR B — /emergency-symptoms
“Is This an Emergency? What To Do Next”

This becomes your decision engine.

B1 — Symptoms Are Grouped by Action, Not Body Part

Reason: Owners don’t think anatomically when panicking.

Groups (example)

Breathing & Collapse

Bleeding & Trauma

Poisoning & Toxins

Neurological (seizure, collapse)

Urinary blockages

Heat stroke

B2 — Each Symptom Card Has 4 Mandatory Sections
Template (EN)

Symptoms
Short, recognisable signs (owner language)

Why this is urgent
1 sentence medical explanation

What to do now
Clear instruction:

Use PetSOS now

Go immediately

Do not wait

What info helps hospitals respond faster
Example:

breathing rate

toxin ingested

time of onset

This last section is pure GEO gold — no one else publishes this.

B3 — Soft Routing to Hospital Capability (Non-Promotional)

Without naming EI or others:

Example:

“Hospitals with oxygen therapy and ICU support are usually required.”

This subtly connects symptoms → capability → hospital pages.

Acceptance (Pillar B)

Every symptom page answers “what now?”

No diagnosis claims

Strong alignment with EI capability language (but neutral)

OPTIONAL BOOST (Low Effort, High Return)
C — Add “Emergency Checklist” Download (Optional)

One PDF

EN + 繁中

“What to prepare while heading to hospital”

This increases:

time on site

authority

offline utility

Phase 3 Engineering Scope (Reality Check)

This phase is mostly content + light UI.

No DB changes
No schema invention
No hospital dependency

Estimated effort:

Content: 1–2 days

UI wiring: 1 day

QA: < 1 day
