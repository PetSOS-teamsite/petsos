Phase 3 (Revised & Locked)
Emergency & Symptoms GEO Pillars

Status: Approved with refinements
Risk level: Controlled
Primary upgrade: Medical safety + AI parsing precision

🔒 GLOBAL SAFETY & GOVERNANCE (NEW — MUST IMPLEMENT)

These apply to all Phase 3 pages.

1) Medical Disclaimer (Mandatory, Prominent)

Appears:

Above the fold (small but visible)

In footer

In <meta> description (short form)

EN

⚠️ This information is for emergency guidance only and not veterinary advice. Always consult a licensed veterinarian as soon as possible.

繁中

⚠️ 本頁資料只供緊急參考，並非獸醫診斷或建議。請盡快諮詢註冊獸醫。

✅ This mitigates HIGH medical liability risk.

2) Language Guardrails (Locked)

Never use

“This is an emergency”

“Your pet needs surgery”

“Call now”

Always use

“May require immediate attention”

“Hospitals with X capability may be needed”

“Contact a hospital promptly”

This applies to all copy + headings.

3) Timestamp Authority (NEW)

Add to:

/emergency

/emergency-symptoms

each symptom page

Footer line

Reviewed by veterinary professionals — January 2026

Use lastReviewedAt internally for future updates.

PILLAR A (REVISED) — /emergency
“What should I do if my pet has an emergency in Hong Kong?”

This page becomes a MedicalWebPage + SoftwareApplication + HowTo hub.

A0 — Schema Stack (Updated)

Add (additive, not replacing existing):

MedicalWebPage

SoftwareApplication (already added)

HowTo (already exists)

FAQPage (exists)

Why

MedicalWebPage = health intent clarity

HowTo = step parsing

SoftwareApplication = tool identity

A1 — Above-the-Fold Crisis Orientation (Refined)

Add AI-summary block for LLMs.

Visible copy (EN)

If your pet shows signs that may indicate an emergency, don’t wait.
PetSOS helps you reach nearby 24-hour animal hospitals quickly, so you’re not calling clinics one by one during a critical moment.

sr-only AI summary (≈50 words, EN)

PetSOS is a free emergency coordination tool for Hong Kong pet owners. It allows users to broadcast urgent pet medical situations to multiple 24-hour animal hospitals at once, helping owners identify which hospitals may be able to take the case during late nights, holidays, or typhoons.

(Repeat in 繁中.)

A2 — “What Happens After You Tap Emergency” (AI-Optimized)

Implementation upgrade

Use semantic <ol>

Map steps to HowToStep schema

Steps (neutral, non-promissory)

Describe the situation (text or voice)

Your request is shared with nearby 24-hour hospitals

Hospitals that are able to respond may reply

You decide where to go

No guarantees. No urgency pressure.

A3 — “When Should I Use PetSOS?” (Converted to FAQ)

This directly addresses reviewer feedback.

Question (exact-match heading)

When should I use PetSOS?

Answer (EN)

PetSOS is designed for situations where your pet may require urgent veterinary attention and you are unsure which 24-hour hospital can take the case, especially late at night, on holidays, or during typhoons.

Add FAQ schema.

A4 — Expanded Emergency FAQs (Locked Set)

Add these exact questions (short answers, ≤40 words):

Is PetSOS available 24/7?

Does PetSOS charge a fee?

Can PetSOS guarantee treatment?

Can I use PetSOS for non-emergencies?

What if no hospital replies?

These directly match AI query patterns.

Acceptance — Pillar A

Page qualifies as MedicalWebPage

HowTo steps parse cleanly

FAQ rich results valid

Disclaimer visible without scrolling

PILLAR B (REVISED) — /emergency-symptoms
“Signs that may indicate a pet emergency”

This becomes a decision router, not a diagnosis page.

B0 — URL & Canonical Strategy (Approved)

/emergency-symptoms → index / overview

/emergency-symptoms/[slug] → individual symptom pages (recommended)

This is optional but strongly encouraged for featured snippets.

B1 — Heading Strategy (Critical Change)

Use question-format headings only.

❌ “Breathing Emergencies”
✅ “What should I do if my cat is panting heavily?”

This aligns exactly with search + AI prompts.

B2 — Symptom Card Structure (Locked)

Each symptom page/card must follow this exact semantic structure:

<article itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/MedicalCondition">
  <h2 itemprop="name">What should I do if my dog is having trouble breathing?</h2>

  <section data-section="symptoms">
    <h3>Signs that may indicate urgency</h3>
  </section>

  <section data-section="urgency">
    <h3>Why this may need immediate attention</h3>
  </section>

  <section data-section="action">
    <h3>What to do now</h3>
  </section>

  <section data-section="hospital-info">
    <h3>Hospital capabilities that may be required</h3>
  </section>
</article>


Add MedicalCondition schema with:

signOrSymptom

possibleTreatment (generic, non-prescriptive)

B3 — “What Information Helps Hospitals Respond Faster” (Enhanced)

No change in concept — just format upgrade

Use <dl> definition list

This is your highest GEO value section

Example:

Time symptoms started

Breathing rate

Known toxin exposure

Existing medical conditions

B4 — Soft Capability Routing (Safe Version)

Use phrasing like:

Hospitals with oxygen therapy and intensive care support may be required for these signs.

Then link:

Capability → filtered hospital list
(No hospital names, no ranking.)

B5 — AI Summary Block (Per Symptom)

Hidden sr-only block, bilingual, ~40 words.

This is how AI lifts content verbatim.

Acceptance — Pillar B

No diagnostic claims

MedicalCondition schema valid

Question-format headings used

Each symptom page stands alone as an answer

OPTIONAL BOOST (APPROVED WITH SAFETY)

Implementation rule

HTML page first: /emergency-checklist (indexable)
