Phase 4 — Hyper-Local District Emergency Guides

Objective:
Turn each /district/:code page into a trusted, AI-citable emergency hub that answers:

“What should I do here, right now, if my pet needs emergency care?”

This is where near-me + panic + logistics converge.

Phase 4 Success Criteria (Lock This)

Phase 4 is complete when:

Each priority district page answers local emergency realities, not just lists hospitals

AI can cite PetSOS for:

“Emergency vet in [district]”

“Where to go during typhoon in [district]”

“How to get to a 24h vet from [district]”

No new medical liability is introduced

No partner coordination is required

Phase 4A — Page Role Redefinition (What Changes)
Before (Current)

/district/:code
→ Hospital listing + filters

After (Phase 4)

/district/:code
→ District Emergency Guide + Hospital Directory

Think:

“Emergency care in Eastern District (Hong Kong)”

Hospitals remain important — but context comes first.

Phase 4B — District Page Structure (Final)

Each district page gets 6 consistent blocks, all data-safe.

BLOCK 1 — District Emergency Overview (NEW)

Purpose: Orient users + AI immediately.

Content (EN)

Emergency care for pets in {{District Name}}
If your pet shows signs that may require urgent veterinary attention in {{District Name}}, this page helps you understand local emergency options, transport considerations, and nearby 24-hour animal hospitals.

繁中

{{District Name}} 寵物急症支援
如你的寵物在 {{District Name}} 出現可能需要即時處理的情況，本頁提供本區急症應診資訊、交通提示及附近 24 小時動物醫院。

Rules

Neutral tone

No diagnosis

No hospital ranking

BLOCK 2 — “What to Know in This District” (Local Reality)

Purpose: Hyper-local information AI prefers.

Examples (auto-templated, editable later):

High-density residential area

Narrow roads / limited parking

Common transport mode: taxi / MTR + taxi

Travel time variability at night

Example (EN)

Local considerations
• Traffic congestion is common during peak hours
• Parking near hospitals may be limited
• Most pet owners rely on taxis or ride-hailing at night

BLOCK 3 — Typhoon & Weather Reality (HK Moat)

Purpose: District-specific emergency truth.

Content

General T8 / T10 guidance

Transport disruption note

Link to /typhoon-status

EN

During typhoons
During T8 or above, public transport may be limited. Road transport is usually required to reach emergency hospitals. Always confirm hospital availability before departure.

繁中

颱風期間提示
八號或以上風球時，公共交通或受影響，通常需使用道路交通前往急症醫院。

BLOCK 4 — Nearest Verified 24-Hour Hospitals (Enhanced Existing)

Purpose: Decision support, not promotion.

Rules

Only verified hospitals

Partner badge allowed

No “best”, no ranking language

Distance shown if location available

This block uses your existing hospital directory logic.

BLOCK 5 — “If You’re Unsure Where to Go” (PetSOS Bridge)

Purpose: Route uncertainty → PetSOS without sales tone.

EN

If you’re unsure which hospital in {{District Name}} can take your case right now, you can use PetSOS to contact multiple nearby 24-hour hospitals at once.

繁中

如不確定 {{District Name}} 哪間醫院可即時接收個案，可使用 PetSOS 同時聯絡多間附近的 24 小時動物醫院。

This subtly reinforces the platform’s role.

BLOCK 6 — Trust Footer (Lightweight)

Purpose: Freshness + authority.

Last updated timestamp

Data source note

EN

Information is reviewed regularly. Hospital availability may change. Please confirm before arrival.

Phase 4C — Priority Rollout Order (Recommended)

Start where:

You already have hospital strength

Population density is high

Emergency demand is realistic

Wave 1 (Immediate)

Eastern District

Central & Western

Wan Chai

Wave 2

Kowloon City

Yau Tsim Mong

Shatin

You don’t need all 18 districts at once.

Phase 4D — Schema Enhancements (Low Effort, High Return)

On /district/:code add:

MedicalWebPage

CollectionPage (already exists)

areaServed = district

about = “Pet emergency care in {{district}}”

This reinforces local medical relevance without adding new liability.

Phase 4E — Internal Linking Strategy (Critical for GEO)

Add consistent links:

District → Emergency (/emergency)

District → Symptoms (/emergency-symptoms)

Symptoms → District (contextual: “If you’re in Eastern District…”)

Hospital → District (breadcrumb already exists)

This creates a tight semantic loop AI systems love.

Phase 4F — What We Explicitly Avoid

To keep risk low:

❌ No medical advice
❌ No symptom diagnosis
❌ No hospital ranking language
❌ No partner promotion copy
❌ No new schemas that require medical validation

Phase 4 Engineering Scope (Reality Check)

Mostly content + layout reuse

No DB schema changes

No partner dependency

No new user flows

Estimated effort

Content templating: 1 day

District data wiring: 0.5–1 day

QA: < 1 day

Phase 4 Completion Checklist

Before sign-off:
