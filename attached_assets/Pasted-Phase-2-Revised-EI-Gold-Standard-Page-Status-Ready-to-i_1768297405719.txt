Phase 2 (Revised) — EI Gold Standard Page

Status: Ready to implement
Risk: Low
Nature: UI logic + copy refinement (no schema change required)

Reference anchor: East Island 24-Hour Animal Hospital

GLOBAL RULES (Lock These First)

These apply to all blocks:

Hide empty sections completely (never show “N/A”)

Never infer capabilities

Exact numbers > generic text (where verified)

EI-only enhancements must be gated by ReferencePartner

Non-EI hospitals fall back to neutral, public-source wording

BLOCK-BY-BLOCK REFINEMENTS (Final)
BLOCK 1 — “What This Hospital Is Best For” (Refined Logic)

Change: Add deterministic ranking + Oxygen Therapy

Derivation logic (max 5 bullets)

Priority order:

ICU / Critical Care

Emergency Surgery

Advanced Imaging

Blood & Oxygen Support

Exotic / Special Species

Explicit rule

If oxygenTherapy = true, always include “Oxygen therapy & respiratory support”

Oxygen is high-intent for breathing distress searches

Final EN copy (EI)

Best suited for emergencies involving:
• Critical care & intensive monitoring
• Trauma, collapse & breathing distress
• Emergency surgery (soft tissue & orthopaedic)
• Advanced imaging (CT / Ultrasound)
• Oxygen therapy & blood transfusion support

Final 繁中

特別適合處理以下緊急情況：
• 危急個案及深切治療監察
• 外傷、突然倒下、呼吸困難
• 緊急手術（軟組織／骨科）
• 先進影像診斷（CT／超聲波）
• 氧氣治療及輸血支援

BLOCK 2 — Emergency Capability Matrix (Refined)

Change: Explicit Oxygen + section skipping logic

Section rules

Show section only if ≥1 capability = true

Oxygen Therapy must appear under Life Support

Life Support section (EI example)

Oxygen Therapy ✅

Ventilator Support ✅

Blood Transfusion ✅

Dialysis (if true)

Why this matters

“Oxygen therapy” is a panic keyword

EI is one of the few HK hospitals with full respiratory support 24/7

BLOCK 3 — Triage, Wait-Time & Intake Status (Upgraded)

Change: Add intake clarity + schema alignment

UI logic

liveStatus pill:

normal → green

busy → amber

critical_only → red

Text always explains triage over arrival order

Copy addition (EN)

Accepting emergency patients:
Status updates reflect current intake capacity and may change rapidly.

GEO refinement (behind the scenes)

Set isAcceptingNewPatients = true in schema when:

isAvailable = true

liveStatus ≠ critical_only

This improves AI selection during crisis queries.

BLOCK 4 — Consultation Fees (EI Precision Mode)

Change: Use exact verified fee for EI

EI-specific rule (ReferencePartner only)

Show exact figure when confirmed

Final EI EN copy

Emergency consultation fees (reference)
• Evening & Midnight (from 8:30 PM): HK$1,100

Fees vary depending on case complexity and required treatment.

Why this is important

AI models quote exact numbers ~4× more often

This positions PetSOS as the fee authority for midnight searches

Non-EI fallback

Continue using bands or “contact hospital”

BLOCK 5 — Typhoon & Holiday Operations (HK Moat 강화)

Change: Add Transport Warning

Add below status table (EN)

Transport note during T8 / T10:
MTR services may be suspended. Road transport (taxi or van) is usually required.

繁中

八號／十號風球交通提示：
港鐵露天路段或會暫停服務，通常需要使用的士或私家車前往。

This is highly HK-specific and strongly favored by GEO.

BLOCK 6 — Panic Logistics (Upgraded)

Change: Add Pet Ambulance + Taxi surcharge

Add section (EN)

Emergency transport options
• Taxi / Uber Pet (common in HK, may charge ~HK$5 per pet)
• Pet Club HK Ambulance: 9782 2999 (oxygen & stretcher support)

繁中

緊急運送選項
• 的士／Uber Pet（一般可攜帶寵物，或加收約 HK$5）
• Pet Club HK 寵物救護車：9782 2999（提供氧氣及擔架）

This is pure information gain competitors do not offer.

BLOCK 7 — Verification & Trust Footer (Confirmed, No Change)

Change: None — already excellent

Rule recap

“Validated with EI” line → ReferencePartner only

Others show:

“Information sourced from public records. Please confirm with hospital before arrival.”

This protects relationships and credibility.

IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY (What Dev Actually Needs To Do)
Code changes

UI logic only (no DB changes)

3 small conditionals:

Oxygen Therapy prominence

EI exact fee override

Transport warning visibility

No changes needed

DB schema

Indexing

Core entity schema (except optional isAcceptingNewPatients boolean mapping)

Phase 2 Acceptance Checklist (Final)

Before marking Phase 2 complete:

 EI page shows Oxygen Therapy clearly

 EI fee shows HK$1,100 (not band)

 Triage block includes intake clarity

 Typhoon block includes transport warning

 Pet ambulance number visible

 Non-EI hospitals gracefully hide missing data

 Page reads calm, factual, non-promotional

Strategic Note (Important)

At this point, EI’s page will likely be the most information-dense emergency hospital page in Hong Kong.

That’s not a content win — that’s a GEO moat.
