Phase 1 — Entity & Schema Foundation (Execution Plan)

Duration: ~5–7 engineering days
Objective:
Make PetSOS unambiguously understood as:

a software emergency utility, and

a verified emergency hospital knowledge graph for Hong Kong.

Phase 1 Success Criteria (Lock This)

Phase 1 is complete only when:

✅ PetSOS is classified as a SoftwareApplication (not blog, not directory)

✅ Every hospital page outputs valid VeterinaryCare schema

✅ District pages output machine-readable hospital collections

✅ Schema tests pass with no critical errors

✅ EI is clearly understood as a verified emergency provider entity

1️⃣ Site-Wide Entity Definition (PetSOS = Software Utility)
Pages

/

/emergency

Required JSON-LD (static, site-owned)
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
  "name": "PetSOS",
  "applicationCategory": "MedicalApplication",
  "operatingSystem": ["Web", "iOS", "Android"],
  "offers": {
    "@type": "Offer",
    "price": "0",
    "priceCurrency": "HKD"
  },
  "description": "PetSOS is a free emergency coordination tool that helps Hong Kong pet owners reach 24-hour animal hospitals faster by broadcasting emergencies to multiple clinics at once.",
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "PetSOS"
  },
  "areaServed": {
    "@type": "AdministrativeArea",
    "name": "Hong Kong"
  }
}

Why this matters

Prevents PetSOS being interpreted as “just another blog”

Enables tool-based AI citations

Supports mobile + PWA discovery

Owner: Engineering
Acceptance check:
Google Rich Results Test → recognized as SoftwareApplication.

2️⃣ Organization Entity (Trust & EEAT Anchor)
Page

/about

Required JSON-LD
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "PetSOS",
  "url": "https://petsos.site",
  "description": "PetSOS is a non-profit emergency coordination platform for pet owners in Hong Kong.",
  "areaServed": "HK"
}

Notes

Keep non-profit / public utility tone

No founder bios needed yet

Avoid marketing claims

Owner: Engineering / Content
Acceptance check:
Organization appears as separate entity from hospitals.

3️⃣ Hospital Entity Schema (Dynamic, Critical)
Pages

/hospitals/:slug

Each hospital page must dynamically output:

VeterinaryCare

nested MedicalOrganization

EmergencyService context

Core Mapping (from your DB)
Schema Property	DB Field
@type	VeterinaryCare
name	nameEn (+ alternateName = nameZh)
address	addressEn / addressZh
geo	latitude / longitude
telephone	phone
url	hospital page URL
openingHoursSpecification	open247
areaServed	regions.nameEn
availableService	derived from booleans
medicalSpecialty	emergency, surgery, imaging

⚠️ Important rule
Only include services where DB field = true.
No inferred or assumed capabilities.

Reference Partner Signal (EI)

For East Island 24-Hour Animal Hospital only, add:

"additionalProperty": {
  "@type": "PropertyValue",
  "name": "ReferencePartner",
  "value": "PetSOS"
}


This subtly reinforces entity co-occurrence without marketing language.

Owner: Engineering
Acceptance check:
Schema validator shows valid VeterinaryCare entity.

4️⃣ Breadcrumb Schema (Navigation Clarity)
Pages

/hospitals/:slug

/district/:code

Example
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Hospitals",
      "item": "https://petsos.site/hospitals"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,
      "name": "Eastern District",
      "item": "https://petsos.site/district/eastern"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 3,
      "name": "East Island 24-Hour Animal Hospital",
      "item": "https://petsos.site/hospitals/east-island-24-hour-animal-hospital"
    }
  ]
}


Why

Reinforces location hierarchy

Improves district-level GEO understanding

5️⃣ District Collection Schema (Hyper-Local GEO)
Pages

/district/:code

Required Schema
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "CollectionPage",
  "name": "24-Hour Animal Hospitals in Eastern District",
  "mainEntity": {
    "@type": "ItemList",
    "itemListElement": [
      {
        "@type": "ListItem",
        "position": 1,
        "item": {
          "@id": "https://petsos.site/hospitals/east-island-24-hour-animal-hospital"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

Rules

Only include verified hospitals

Order by proximity or relevance (not random)

Owner: Engineering
Acceptance check:
LLMs can infer “Eastern District → EI → emergency”.

6️⃣ FAQ Schema (Already Built — Just Lock Rules)
Pages

/emergency

/emergency-symptoms

/hospitals/:slug (auto-generated FAQs)

Rules

FAQs must be factual

No “best”, “top”, or promotional claims

Keep answers short and precise

Owner: Content / Engineering
Acceptance check:
Rich Results Test → FAQ eligible.

Phase 1 Final Checklist

 SoftwareApplication schema live on / + /emergency

 Organization schema live on /about

 VeterinaryCare schema on all /hospitals/:slug

 EI marked as reference partner
